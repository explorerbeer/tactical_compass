## CREDITS
The implementation of the compass behavior was taken from the [A.N.T.T.H.O.L.O.L.O.G.Y. modpack](https://ap-pro.ru/forums/topic/4266-anomaly-anthology-12/).
The code for getting target coordinates was adapted and taken [from the Ubisoft Friendly HUD](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/hud-ubisoft-friendly) mod.
For my part, I implemented the calculation of the marker position relative to the target, refactored the code and also added an MCM option to disable the compass.
All additional information is in the mod scripts.

Special thanks to VodoXleb, xcvb (bcvx), RavenAscendant for their help.

## ROADMAP

1. Rework the target coordinates acquisition so that the marker is displayed regardless of location.
2. Adding new variants of compasses and markers.
3. Editing the compass position via MSM.
4. (No promises). Displaying stashes or something similar.
5. Correct the directional calculation. 
6. (No promises). Setting compass dimensions.
7. Change the size of the marker relative to the distance.
